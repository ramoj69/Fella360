														<p><strong>The US released popular phishing techniques:</strong> The United States government released a guide regarding the most popular phishing techniques. It defines phishing as “a cyberattack that uses deception to trick people into giving away sensitive information or taking actions that compromise security.” Everyone should read these tips to remain secure online, even those outside the US. People should take phishing and other online schemes seriously because we all store our data online. Otherwise, they may lose sensitive information to shady, unknown individuals and groups who may use it for nefarious purposes. Worse, businesses may lose company secrets and shed stock value and investors.

														<p><strong>Phishing for Credentials:</strong> It involves hackers pretending to be someone you trust. They will request your login credentials to access your resources and systems. The earliest version uses emails that seemingly come from your boss, co-worker, or IT staff. Some send text messages or use chat platforms to trick you into giving your login info. Others use internet phone services to fake caller IDs, posing as legitimate numbers.You can protect yourself by implementing Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) for emails. Also, you may set this system to “reject” for outgoing emails. You should also have multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your credentials. Moreover, set it up to lock out and alert you automatically if it senses suspicious activity.

														</p>

														<p><strong>Phishing for Malware:</strong> Hackers can use phishing to plant malware into your systems. They could send links or attachments hidden inside seemingly innocuous folders. Others may urge you to download smartphone apps or open text message links to deliver malicious content. Fortunately, you can stop it by only giving yourself administrator privileges to your computer and nobody else. Add more protection by disabling macros by default and using remote browser isolation solutions and protective DNS resolvers. Create denylists for your email gateway and firewall rules to block malware delivery.
