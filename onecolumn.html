											DFA poses Filipino showbiz questions to foil ‘impostors’: “Who is the Superstar’s love team partner?” “Name one of the Megastar’s songs.” “Who is the Star for All Seasons? Passport processors in consular offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) have lately resorted to asking such trivia questions from local show business to catch foreign nationals illegally applying for Philippine passports, most of them from China. The DFA said it was “actively engaging (with) law enforcement agencies” to file criminal charges against the foreigners. Because some of the suspected impostors can speak Filipino, DFA consular office front-liners have devised their own methods to determine whether applicants are Filipino, as their documents claim.

So we think outside the box,” Foreign Assistant Secretary Adelio Angelito Cruz of the Office of the Consular Affairs said in an interview. “If you’re really a Filipino, who was Nora Aunor’s boyfriend? You’re saying you’re 34 years old. Who was Sharon Cuneta’s longtime boyfriend? These are facts that only Filipinos know, right?” he said. “What are Andrew E.’s songs? What’s your favorite Ariel Rivera song? Anything that we can relate to and we answer without even thinking,” Cruz added.
