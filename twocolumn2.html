											Tencent is reportedly working on the mobile version of the hit console game Elden Ring: Elden Ring debuted back in 2022 for $60 and sold about 20 million copies during its first year on the market after Tencent acquired the licensing rights to the game from its developer, From Software, making it the world’s second-best-selling game of the year.

										</p>

										<p> Game of Thrones renowned author George R. R. Martine and veteran game designer Hidetaka Miyazaki are the geniuses behind Elden Ring, a game where players are battling against mythical monsters in a fantasy world

										</p>

										<p>
											The console version of Elden Ring originally costs around 60$, but Tencent wants to make its mobile version a free-to-play one with in-app purchases, just like the hit RPG Genshin Impact.
										</p>

										<p>Additionally, according to the source, the Elden Ring mobile version will be completely redesigned due to the console version's complex mechanics and interactions, making it impossible to work on mobile devices.

										</p>

										<p>While Elden Ring Mobile is taking too “slow” to develop, its announcement and official release will probably take a while to be confirmed. But while waiting, Elden Ring fans may also check out From Software's Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, coming to Android and iOS device
